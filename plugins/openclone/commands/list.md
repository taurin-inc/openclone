description: List all openclone clones with their categories, marking the active one

List every openclone clone the user has defined, showing each clone's categories as tags, with the active clone marked.

Steps:

1. If `~/.openclone/clones/` does not exist or has no `.md` files, tell the user they have no clones yet and suggest `/openclone:new <name>`. Stop.

2. Read the active clone name from `~/.openclone/active-clone` (may not exist).

3. For each `.md` file directly under `~/.openclone/clones/` (no recursion — storage is flat), read the frontmatter to extract `display_name`, `tagline`, `categories`, `primary_category`.

4. Render a compact list, one line per clone:

   ```
   - douglas       권도균 — 프라이머 대표                 [founder*, vc]   [active]
   - mk            Min-Kyu — Backend, distributed systems  [dev*]
   ```

   - Format: `- <name>   <display_name> — <tagline>   [<categories with primary marked by *>]   [active]?`
   - Primary category in the categories bracket is marked with a trailing `*`.
   - The `[active]` tag only appears for the currently active clone.
   - If no tagline, show just the display_name.

5. At the end, print a one-line hint:
   > Run `/openclone:use <name>` to activate one, or `/openclone:new <name>` to create a new clone.
